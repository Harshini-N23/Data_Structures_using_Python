# Data Structures using Python

Welcome to the "Data Structures using Python" repository! This repository is a comprehensive resource for exploring various data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. 

# Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of computer science and programming. They are essential tools for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. This repository is designed to be your guide on a journey through the world of data structures and algorithms, using the Python programming language. From basic data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists to advanced topics like trees and graphs, we cover a wide range of concepts and provide clear, Python-based implementations.

## 1. Data Structures

### **Stack**

Explore the stack data structure, which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Understand how to push and pop elements using Python Lists, collections.deque module and using Queue Module

### **Queue**

Dive into queues, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Learn about enqueue and dequeue operations using Python List and dequue module.

### **Linked List**

Understand the concept of linked lists, a versatile linear data structure.

### **Stack using Linked List**

Implement a stack using a linked list, combining the benefits of both data structures.

### **Deque using Doubly Linked List**

Create a deque (double-ended queue) using a doubly linked list, allowing efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.

## 2. Searching Algorithms

This program demonstrates the use of Linear Search and Binary Search. Learn the binary search algorithm for efficiently finding an element in a sorted array using Iterative and Recursive Approach.

## 3. Sorting Algorithms

Explore the simple bubble sort algorithm, which repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements until the array is sorted. Understand its basic mechanics and performance characteristics.Dive into the selection sort algorithm, which iteratively selects the minimum element and places it in the appropriate position. Learn its time complexity and implementation details.
The first code snippet allows us to enter the number of elements to be taken for sorting whereas the second snippet automatically uses the random number generator to generate a sequence of elements and performs the sorting based on the user input.

## 4. Trees

### **Binary Tree**

Explore the concept of binary trees, where each node has at most two children. Understand the structure and common operations associated with binary trees.

### **Binary Search Tree**
Delve into the binary search tree, a specialized binary tree designed for efficient searching and sorting. Learn how it maintains the binary search property.

## 5. Graph

### **Graph Basics**

Introduce yourself to graph theory and the fundamentals of graphs. Explore how to create graphs in python, adjacency matrix, function to find the number of vertices and edges and indegree and outdegree of a graph.


### **Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm**

Dive into graph algorithms by finding the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in the graph. Understand the theory and implementation of this fundamental graph problem.
